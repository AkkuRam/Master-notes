- What is Systems Biology?
    - An interdisciplinary field which integrates computational and mathematical approaches to study complex biological interactions through

- **Dataset**: NHANES
- Economic burden has increased (i.e. medical costs) to deal with obesity and diabetes
- Both conditions obesity + diabetes, increase risk for cardiovascular diseases


- Waist circumference -> Abdominal obesity (high WC -> high AO)
- Agricultural subsidies in the US more some crops -> more production -> therefore emergence of more corn based sweetners HFCS (High fructose corn syrup) -> more health problems (more sugar and calorie intake)
- Consumption of fruits and vegetables was noticed as a healthy diet

# Paper - Zeevi Summary

- **Postprandial glycemic response**: amount of sugar in your blood after you eat
- Monitoring glucose levels in a 800-person cohort
- ML algorithm was developed which uses features (i.e. physical activity, dietary habits, etc) to predict personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals
- Training set: 800, Test set: 100


- Some common factors associated with PPGR after standardized meals are: HbAlc, BMI, systolic blood pressure and  alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
- Microbiome features: Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae exhibit positive correlations with few standardized meals PPGR
- Overall, clinical and microbiome features could predict PPGR after meals accurately on train and test set
