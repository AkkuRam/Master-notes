# Systems Biology Definition

- What is Systems Biology?
    - An multidisciplinary field which integrates computational and mathematical approaches to study complex biological interactions 

# Paper - Bhupathiraju Summary

- **Dataset**: NHANES
- Economic burden has increased (i.e. medical costs) to deal with obesity and diabetes
- Both conditions obesity + diabetes, increase risk for cardiovascular diseases


- Waist circumference -> Abdominal obesity (high WC -> high AO)
- Agricultural subsidies in the US more some crops -> more production -> therefore emergence of more corn based sweetners HFCS (High fructose corn syrup) -> more health problems (more sugar and calorie intake)
- Consumption of fruits and vegetables was noticed as a healthy diet

# Paper - Zeevi Summary

- **Postprandial glycemic response**: amount of sugar in your blood after you eat
- Monitoring glucose levels in a 800-person cohort
- ML algorithm was developed which uses features (i.e. physical activity, dietary habits, etc) to predict personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals
- Training set: 800, Test set: 100


- Some common factors associated with PPGR after standardized meals are: HbAlc, BMI, systolic blood pressure and  alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
- Microbiome features: Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae exhibit positive correlations with few standardized meals PPGR
- Overall, clinical and microbiome features could predict PPGR after meals accurately on train and test set

###  Systems Biology

- Capture biological systems in mathematical models -> understand and predict biological systems -> holistic approach

### Biological systems

- Amazon rainforest
- Namibian desert
- Fish pond
- Kidneys
- Mitochondria

### Why are biological systems hard to grasp?

- Complex
- Change over time
- Heterogeneous
- Not built by us
- Behave non-linearly

### Multilevel vs Multiscale modelling

- **Multilevel**: considers dynamic processes at multiple levels (e.g. cellular, tissue level) of biological systems
    - Example: model for analysing brain tissue
- **Multiscale**: modelling incorporates multiple different temporal and spatial scales in one model, regardless of whether the model has mutiple levels
    - Example: simulating floods on buildings

### Top down vs Bottom up approach

- **Top-down**: determine general principles, start with limited data and use an optimization algorithm
    - breaking down a complex system to gain insight
- **Bottom-up**: detailed experimental data collected one by one to combine it into a bigger system
    - piecing together of smaller systems to form a complex system
