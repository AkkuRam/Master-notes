# Lecture 1 - Human Physiology

### Unicellular organisms

- Living entities that have only one cell
    - Bacteria
    - Potists
    - Some Algae
    - Yeast

### Multicellular organisms

- Many different cell types
- Cell specialization 
- Specific functions

### Anatomy vs Physiology

- Anatomy: Identification and description of structures of the body
- Physiology: Science of life that helps us understand how the body works

### Tissues

- Group of similar cells together to perform a specific function
- Function of part organ depends on what tissues it is made of

### Primary tissue types 

- Nervous tissue (control and communication)
    - Made of 2 types of cell: Neurons and Glial cells
    - Neurons: sensing stimuli and sends electric pulses through the body
    - Glial cells: support neurons, insulation and protection
- Muscle tissues (movement)
    - allows you to move
    - types: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle
- Epithelial tissues (cover and protect the body)
- Connective tissues (provide support)

### Muscle tissue

- Skeletal muscle tissue
    - Multinuclear, Striated, Long & cylindrical, voluntary movement
    - Voluntary movement


- Cardiac muscle tissue
    - Short and branched, uninucleated, striated, involuntary, intercalated disks


- Smooth muscle tissue
    - Spindle shaped, uninucleated, non-striated, involuntary 

### Epithelial tissue

- Proper epithelium
    - covers and lines your inner and outer body
    - protects against injury and infection

- Glandular epithelium
    - forms glands and secretes hormones and other substances  

### Connective tissue

- Most abundant and complex
- 4 types: Proper (e.g. fat), Cartilage, Bone, Blood


- Functions of connective tissue
    - Binding and supporting (bone/cartilage)
    - Protecting (bone)
    - Insulating (fat)
    - Storing reserve fluids and energy (e.g. fat)
    - Transporting substances within the body (e.g. blood)
    - Movement (bone)
