# Lecture 1 - Human Physiology

### Unicellular organisms

- Living entities that have only one cell
    - Bacteria
    - Potists
    - Some Algae
    - Yeast

### Multicellular organisms

- Many different cell types
- Cell specialization 
- Specific functions

### Anatomy vs Physiology

- Anatomy: Identification and description of structures of the body
- Physiology: Science of life that helps us understand how the body works

### Tissues

- Group of similar cells together to perform a specific function
- Function of part organ depends on what tissues it is made of

### Primary tissue types 

- Nervous tissue (control and communication)
    - Made of 2 types of cell: Neurons and Glial cells
    - Neurons: sensing stimuli and sends electric pulses through the body
    - Glial cells: support neurons, insulation and protection
- Muscle tissues (movement)
    - allows you to move
    - types: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle
- Epithelial tissues (cover and protect the body)
- Connective tissues (provide support)

### Muscle tissue

- Skeletal muscle tissue
    - Multinuclear, Striated, Long & cylindrical, voluntary movement
    - Voluntary movement


- Cardiac muscle tissue
    - Short and branched, uninucleated, striated, involuntary, intercalated disks


- Smooth muscle tissue
    - Spindle shaped, uninucleated, non-striated, involuntary 

### Epithelial tissue

- Proper epithelium
    - covers and lines your inner and outer body
    - protects against injury and infection

- Glandular epithelium
    - forms glands and secretes hormones and other substances  

### Connective tissue

- Most abundant and complex
- 4 types: Proper (e.g. fat), Cartilage, Bone, Blood


- Functions of connective tissue
    - Binding and supporting (bone/cartilage)
    - Protecting (bone)
    - Insulating (fat)
    - Storing reserve fluids and energy (e.g. fat)
    - Transporting substances within the body (e.g. blood)
    - Movement (bone)


- 3 unique factors of connective tissue
    - Share an origin (form from mesenchyme)
    - Different degrees of vascularity (blood flow)
    - All connective tissues are mostly composed of non-living materal


### Skin

- Protects the body against infection and extreme features temperatures
- Maintains balance of fluids
- Synthesizes vitamin D
- Forms together with nails, hair, sweat and oil glands the integumentary system

### Skin - layers

- Has 3 layers each with their job
    - Epidermis
        - Protection layer for infection/pathogens
        - Regulates amount of water released from body
    - Dermis
        - Most functional parts 
    - Hypodermis
        - Mainly fat storage    
- Contains many immune cells

### Nervous System

- Control room of your body
- Coordinates actions by transmitting signals through the body
- Consists of two parts
    - Central nervous system (CNS)
    - Peripheral nervous system (PNS)

### Central Nervous System (CNS)

- Consists of the brain and spinal cord
- Protected by skull (brain) and vertebrae (spinal cord)
- Integrates receiving information
- Influences activity of body
- Uses the most energy in our body

### Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

- Nerves and ganglia outside the brain
- Main function: connect CNS to limbs and organs
- Unlike CNS it is not protected (i.e. vulnerable)
- PNS can be divided into:
    - Somatic nervous system (voluntary control)
    - Autonomic nervous system (involuntary control)

### Endocrine System

- Gathers information and sends instructions throughout the body, like nervous system does
- Endocrine glands are scattered over your body
- Produce hormones
- Keeps your body in balance (essential for homeostasis)

### Endocrine vs Nervous System

- Signals:
    - NS: electrical impulses (action potentials)
    - ES: chemical impulses (hormones)
- Pathways:
    - NS: transmission by neurons
    - transported by blood
- Speed of information:
    - NS: fast
    - ES: slow
- Duration of effect:
    - NS: short-lived
    - ES: short/long-lived
- Type of action/response:
    - NS: voluntary/involuntary    
    - ES: always involuntary
- Target:
    - localized (cells connected to neurons)
    - often distant (many cells can be affected)

### Endocrine System - Importance?

- Sugar level in your blood goes through the roof
- Pancreas creates insulin to lower blood sugar and stimulate sugar storage in cells

### Endocrine - More info

- A single gland may produce multiple hormones
    - A single hormone may be secreted by more than one 7endocrine gland
    - Single hormone has more than one type of target cell
    - Rate of secretion varies over course of time
    - Some hormones only exist to control other

### Circulatory System

- Cardiovascular system / vascular system
- Transports nutrients, hormones, oxygen, carbon dioxide, blood
- LOOK INTO HOW IT WORKS 

### Digestive System

- Gastrointestinal tract
- Accessory organs of digestion (i.e. tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, gall bladder)
- Function of DS
    - Building blocks for our body
    - Digestion of food (i.e. breakdown into small molecules)
    - Absorption of the right nutrients at the right time
    - Excretion of waste

### Digestion System - The process

- Ingestion - getting food in mouth
- Propulsion - moving food from one region from one region to another
- Mechanical digestion
- Chemical digestion 
- Absorption 
- Defecation
